Happy City
{: .booktitle}
Charles Montgomory
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
An overview of many different policies and ideas on urban designs and programs that make people happy. A huge variety of things discussed under this umbrella. A good overview of many of ideas which are discussed more deeply in other books on this list

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/life_between_buildings.jpg)
Life Between Buildings
{: .booktitle}
Jan Gehl
{: .bookauthor}
A+
{: .bookrating}
First book I read on city design. This book got me into urbanism. An old book, with data on how to make streets so safe that children play on them. Recognizing that streets could be made safe and lively really motivated me to figure out how to actually get these changes implemented in my city.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/cities_for_people.jpg)
Cities for People
{: .booktitle}
Jan Gehl
{: .bookauthor}
A+
{: .bookrating}
Covers many of the same topics as “Life Between Buildings”. If you read that book and also “Soft City”, you can skip this book.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/great_streets.jpg)
Great Streets
{: .booktitle}
Allan B Jacobs
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Case studies of different streets, documenting how they look and what, in the author’s opinion, makes them “great”. An enjoyable read with beautiful illustrations.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/town_planning_in_practice.jpg)
Town Planning in Practice
{: .booktitle}
Raymond Unwin
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
Over 100 years later this book still holds up. The author has obvious enthusiasm for the subject, and the writing is compelling. I think what makes this book timeless is this: It simply talks about what makes a city a nice place to live, with not too much time devoted to political or administrative processes.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/a_pattern_language.jpg)
A Pattern Language
{: .booktitle}
Christopher W. Alexander
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Heavily philosophical. Some interesting ideas, but for the most part impractical. Useful mostly as food for thought.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/seeing_like_a_state.jpg)
Seeing Like a State
{: .booktitle}
James C Scott
{: .bookauthor}
A+
{: .bookrating}
The map is not the territory. Anyone in charge of any large project should read this book. How even well-intentioned schemes can cause mass suffering, and a caution against hubris and over-confidence. The lessons from this book are broadly applicable not just to urbanism, but to political and social systems broadly.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/golden_gates.jpg)
Golden Gates
{: .booktitle}
Conor Dougherty
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
How the California housing crisis created the YIMBY movement. Focused on the SF Bay area and specifically Sanja Trauss, but at the same time providing historical and regional context that created the crisis.


![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/zoned_in_the_usa.jpg)
Zoned in the USA
{: .booktitle}
Sonia A Hirt
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
A comparative study of zoning in the USA, UK and Germany. Specifically calling out the things in us zoning that are unique. Euclidean zoning, minimum lot sizes, exclusively residential areas, etc. Skips over a bit why these idiosyncrasies exist. For that information read “The Color of Law”

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/color_of_law.jpg)
The Color of Law
{: .booktitle}
Richard Rothstein
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
I thought I knew what this book would cover. I was kind of correct, but way off on the magnitude. The history of housing in America is racist in every way imaginable. This book should make you angry.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/strong_towns.jpg)
Strong Towns
{: .booktitle}
Charles L Marohn Jr
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
The central thesis of this book is that building cities in the “traditional” way is financially sustainable in the long term. Building suburbs is not. I may have enjoyed it less because I already knew most of the arguments in the book. But personally I found “Confessions of a Recovering Engineer” to be a much better book overall.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/confessions_of_a_recovering_engineer.jpg)
Confessions of a Recovering Engineer
{: .booktitle}
Charles L Marohn Jr
{: .bookauthor}
A
{: .bookrating}
A perspective on why deadly roads are built. The way the USA builds roads is killing people and ruining communities, and yet it just keeps happening. This book offers an inside look into how and why this keeps happening.

Triumph of the City

This book is a refutation of the notion that cities are dying. I found it boring and stopped reading in the middle of chapter 3

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/geography_of_nowhere.jpg)
The Geography of Nowhere
{: .booktitle}
James Howard Kunstler
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
Suburbs and strip malls no not real places. No one feels affinity or affection for them. This book is more emotion and philosophy. The style did not appeal to me

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/high_cost_of_free_parking.jpg)
The High Cost of Free Parking
{: .booktitle}
Donald Shoup
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Very data-driven book. A thick book devoted to a single subject with a huge amount of data analysis and very specific policy suggestions. All these things appeal to me personally as a reader, but even I struggled at times. Then again, I already was convinced that free parking is bad when I read it. If you are unconvinced that free parking is bad, and you find data and evidence convincing, you should read this book immediately.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/poverty_by_america.jpg)
Poverty, By America
{: .booktitle}
Matthew Desmond
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Case studies on how poverty is created and perpetuated in the USA, with a few policy suggestions near the end. I think this book is a good compendium for the creation of mixed-income neighborhoods. 

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/radical_cities.jpg)
Radical Cities
{: .booktitle}
Justin McGuirk
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Some case studies from different latin american cities on unique solutions for urban problems. Covers bus rapid transit, car-free sundays, gondolas to the favelas, and other latin-american urban innovations.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/retrofitting_suburbia.jpg)
Retrofitting Suburbia
{: .booktitle}
Ellen Dunham-Jones
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
Case studies on urban retrofits applied to suburban areas. I was disappointed specifically because I was hoping for something different. This focuses mostly on transforming suburban strip-malls. But I was wanting some information on applicable policies for already built-out suburban residential sprawl.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/livable_streets.png)
Livable Streets
{: .booktitle}
Donald Appleyard
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Case studies on the benefits of traffic reduction, and various traffic reduction schemes in the USA and UK. Main points: people are more likely to know their neighbors on low traffic streets, and traffic reduction schemes have strong initial opposition but after implementation there is rarely any push to revert the changes.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/child_in_the_city.jpg)
The Child in the City
{: .booktitle}
Colin Ward
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
How and why you should make streets safe for kids. I remember this book only vaguely. However the main premise, that children should be able to play anywhere in a city, is one I agree with strongly.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/how_to_study_public_life.jpg)
How to study Public Life
{: .booktitle}
Jan Gehl, Birgitte Svarre
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
Case studies of studies. Jan talks about how he got started studying pedestrian patterns and other people-focused things in cities.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/new_city_spaces.jpg)
New City Spaces

{: .bookrating}
“We moved to the Netherlands, it is great, here is why”. Not Just Bikes in book form. Well organized and well written. I enjoyed reading despite being already well versed in the subject.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/image_of_the_city.jpg)
The Image of the City
{: .booktitle}
Kevin Lynch
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
How people conceptualize their city. I found it very hard to read and didn’t really understand why anything in the book is significant.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/death_and_life_of_great_american_cities.jpg)
The Death and Life of Great American Cities
{: .booktitle}
Jane Jacobs
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Most of the books I like here quote this book. So perhaps the problem is that I had already become very familiar with the book’s arguments. I read about half way through but did not finish.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/capital_city.jpg)
Capital City
{: .booktitle}
Samuel Stein
{: .bookauthor}
C
{: .bookrating}
Capitalism is bad, gentrification is bad, and a bit in the middle about the Trump family. They are also bad. The book had a lack of cohesion and was not very compelling.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/arbitrary_lines.jpg)
Arbitrary Lines
{: .booktitle}
M Nolan Grey
{: .bookauthor}
B
{: .bookrating}
Zoning is bad, maybe we should get rid of it. It is a short book and a good intro to American zoning. Personally I liked “Zoned in the USA” better.

![book cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/books/carmageddon.jpg)
Carmageddon
{: .booktitle}
B
{: .bookauthor}
When cars were first introduced to cities people hated them, and cities tried to ban them. But somehow that all got flipped around and cities destroyed themselves to make room for cars. How did that happen? This book has some of the answers.

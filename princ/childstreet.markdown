# Children Have Lost The Street

Streets used to be full of kids. No longer.

Walking around town I sometimes see a basketball hoop setup on the curb. But I don't see any kids shooting hoops.

I used to think it was a symptom of modernity. Kids are inside watching TV or playing video games, and not outside playing.

That conclusion was made in ignorance. In some places the streets are still full of kids.

We could have the same here. There are policies that are known to work.

1. **Children 10 and older should be able to walk or bike to all destinations (schools, parks, shops) safely**
2. **There should be a small public play area on every block where children 5 and older can play**

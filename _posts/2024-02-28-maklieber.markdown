# Abe-Koga & Lieber

Margaret Abe-Koga and Sally Lieber are both running for the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors District 5.

Since both served on the Mountain View City Council together, it is possible to have an apples-to-apples comparison of their vote record.

I used the legistar API to fetch every vote where they voted differently.
The results are below.

Much further below is [the code I used to fetch the data](#Code), in case you are curious.
Many jurisdictions use legistar, but the api is poorly documented.

# The Votes

Excluding being absent or [recused](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recuse), Abe-Koga and Lieber differed in votes a total of 29 times in two years.

I have presented the data below exactly as it was retrieved from the api.
Some context is lost, however, so curious readers are encouraged to click "details" to find a page with full minutes and video recordings. 

In particular, the votes shown below may not be the final votes, as in some cases there are several motions associated with an agenda item.
Only those votes where Abe-Koga and Lieber voted differently are documented here.

MOTION - M/S - Lieber/Hicks - To:

Introduce an Ordinance of the City of Mountain View Amending the Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance (Chapter 46 of the Mountain View City Code) to Remove the Exemption for Mobile Home Spaces and Mobile Homes in a Mobile Home Park that Are Subject to an Approved Accord, to be read in title only, further reading waived, and set a second reading for September 13, 2022.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION - M/S - Matichak/Abe-Koga - To:

Keep the exemption in the ordinance and draft an MOU with the following terms from the MOU proposed by Sunset Estates: annual general adjustment methodology, vacancy control, park owner waiving the right to petition, pass through cost methodology, 10-year term, and safety net program. Additional terms to be added: tenants waive the right to petition, mobile home tenants can only be evicted for the specific reasons outlined in the ordinance, establish a process for addressing issues (residents work with park owner first, then proceed to mediation, and finally the City would step in on a cost-recovery basis), a passing percentage for the MOU of 80% of units that vote instead of 80% of residents, drafted by outside counsel, and verify the terms were acceptable to the Sunset Estates Mobile Home Park owner.

In response to Councilmembers Abe-Koga and Kamei, the motion maker amended the substitute motion to include voting to be administered by a third-party and funded by the park owner, replace the City's involvement on a cost-recovery basis with direction to staff to bring back to the Council any startup costs and fees required to administer the program, and direct staff to incorporate more robust outreach to mobile home residents.

#  <a name="Code"></a>The Code

Mountain View uses legistar to store and manage public meeting information.
Legistar has an API, though [the documentation](https://webapi.legistar.com/Help) is sparse.
So a lot of what I know about it is from trial and error.

First I get the ids of Abe-Koga and Lieber from the `/Persons` endpoint

    curl 'https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Persons?$filter=PersonLastName%20eq%20%27Abe-Koga%27%20or%20PersonLastName%20eq%20%27Lieber%27'

Abe-Koga's id is 232, and Lieber's is 513. Next we get all the votes each has cast

    curl https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Persons/513/Votes > Lieber_votes.json
    curl https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Persons/232/Votes > MAK_votes.json

I wrote a python script to find items on which both had voted differently

~~~ python
import sys
import json
from collections import defaultdict

combo = defaultdict(list)
json_in = list(sys.argv[1:])

for fn in json_in:
    with open(fn, 'r') as fob:
        for vote in json.load(fob):
            combo[vote['VoteEventItemId']].append(vote)


ignore_votes = ('Absent', 'Recused')


def key_votes(votes):
    return {v['VotePersonName']: v['VoteValueName'] for v in votes}


def differing_votes(votes):
    vote_values = set(v['VoteValueId'] for v in votes
                      if v['VoteValueName'] not in ignore_votes)
    return len(vote_values) > 1


combined = {k: key_votes(v) for k, v in combo.items()
            if len(v) == len(json_in)
            and differing_votes(v)}

json.dump(combined, sys.stdout)
~~~

And run it to get a json keyed by itemid.

    python3 mergevotes.py MAK_votes.json Lieber_votes.json > combo_votes.json

Unfortunately there is no API for event items.
The only way to access details about these votes is on the `/Event/(EVENT_ID)/EventItems` endpoint.
But we do not know what the event ids are.
So I did an exhaustive search of all events and looked for matching item ids.

I was able to narrow the search with 2 pieces of information. First, I was only interested in city council events,
  so I could filter only the events with `EventBodyId` equal to 138 (the city council body id).
Second I knew that Lieber and Abe-Koga were both serving in council from 2020-2022, so I restricted my search to those years.
It took a few minutes but it did eventually return results.

~~~ python

import sys
import json
import urllib.parse
import urllib.request


with open(sys.argv[1]) as fob:
    vote_data = json.load(fob)


item_ids = set(map(int, vote_data.keys()))
event_url = ('https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Events?'
             '$select=EventId&$orderby=EventId&'
             '$filter=EventBodyId+eq+138+and+year%28EventDate%29+ge+2020'
             '+and+year%28EventDate%29+le+2022+and+EventId+gt+')
item_url = ('https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Events/'
            '{event_id}/EventItems?')


# odata3 does not have an "in" operator
# I tried to do EventItemId eq x or EventItemId eq y ... etc
# But the api barfed after about 20 items. So in the end I used a range
# and did final filtering server side.
def make_filter(ids):
    return f'$filter=EventItemId+ge+{min(ids)}+and+EventItemId+le+{max(ids)}'


# events has a hard limit of 1000, so I built in pagination
# after putting in the body_id and year filters there are fewer results
# so this is probably unnecessary and overengineered
def fetch_event_ids(last_event_id=0):
    if not item_ids:
        return
    url = event_url + str(last_event_id)
    req = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    results = json.load(req)
    if results:
        for result in results:
            event_id = result['EventId']
            yield event_id
        yield from fetch_event_ids(event_id)


def find_items(event_id, item_ids):
    if not item_ids:
        return
    url = item_url.format(event_id=event_id)
    fltr = make_filter(item_ids)
    req = urllib.request.urlopen(url + fltr)
    results = json.load(req)
    if results:
        for result in results:
            if result['EventItemId'] in item_ids:
                item_ids.remove(result['EventItemId'])
                yield {**result, **vote_data[str(result['EventItemId'])]}


def fetch_items():
    for event_id in fetch_event_ids():
        for item in find_items(event_id, item_ids):
            yield item


item_data = list(fetch_items())


# now we have all the event items, I want to get the event metadata
event_ids = set(e['EventItemEventId'] for e in item_data)
# InSiteURL is the web link with links to videos and other relevant things
select = ('EventMinutesFile', 'EventInSiteURL', 'EventDate', 'EventComment')


for event_id in event_ids:
    event_url = (
        f'https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/mountainview/Events/{event_id}')
    req = urllib.request.urlopen(event_url)
    result = json.load(req)
    for item in item_data:
        if item['EventItemEventId'] == event_id:
            for k in select:
                item[k] = result.get(k)


# everything is all together now
json.dump(item_data, sys.stdout)
~~~

And that is pretty much it. Feel free to follow along at home.
This should work on any jurisdiction that uses legistar.
A few I know of are San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and BART.

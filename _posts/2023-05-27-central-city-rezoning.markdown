Why does the zoning map of mountain view look so odd around downtown?

Between 1978 and 1980 there was a massive rezoning of the central city.
This was called the "central city rezoning". There were 16 phases. I was able to find 12. [^1]
They generally follow an east-west trend, so I am confident I have all the rezoning maps west of Castro.

The re-zoning is mostly downzoning. The upzoning that did occur was rezoning between R3 subclasses. [^2]
I have mapped the changes.

This rezoning was part of a nationwide trend of downzoning.

I have high confidence that I have all the rezoning data for the western part, between Castro and Esquela. This area has around 195 acres of residential lots. Nearly one third, around 60 acres, were donwzoned. The area zoned for single family homes only more than doubled, from 35 acres in 1978 to 84 acres in 1980. The vast majority of these were originally zoned mutifamily.

Current construction rates seem high, but they are not yet reaching the levels of housing construction we had in the 1970s. We can attribute part of the blame to downzoning.

But I think it is also interesting to note how many single family homes were built in areas zoned R3.
I sometimes hear the argument that "American's prefer single family homes".
There is some truth to this, but it is not a good argument for keeping R1 zoning.
Single family homes can be built no matter the zoning, and we should keep it that way.
The diversity of homes that exist in the central city is part of the reason I have been able to keep living here as my family has grown. Reverting the zoning back to R3 won't destroy any existing homes or mandate new apartments.
It simply allows for diversity.

[^1]: Most records from before 1979 are missing. I know there are 16 because the later ordinacees were numbered
      But erlier than #9 are not numbered. I found #9-#16 dating from Feburaruy 1979 until March 1980.
      January and March 1979 contain five more unnumbered ordinances that say they are part of the central city rezoning. 

[^2]: R3 is all medium-density multifamily, but there are gradations within R3 that allow for different
      numbers of homes per acre and minimum lot sizes.

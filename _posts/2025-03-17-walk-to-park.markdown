How long will people walk to a park?
It [varies](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/pedestrians-and-park-planning-how-far-will-people-walk/24937/), but studies show that at a quarter mile some people will start driving rather than walking.
Therefor it is considered good planning practice to have a small "neighborhood park" within a quarter mile of residential areas.

Mountain View is doing well by this metric.
More than 80% of the city is within a quarter mile of a park.

There are two large areas that are more than 3/4 of a mile to the nearest park.
These areas are in [North Bayshore](https://www.mountainview.gov/our-city/departments/community-development/planning/active-projects/google-projects/north-bayshore-master-plan) and [East Whisman](https://www.mountainview.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/2310/638143387078230000).
Both these areas are historically office/industrial.
The city has plans to turn both these areas into mixed use developments with more residential and more parks.

These projects are both on hold for the moment, but when the housing does come it will come with many new parks.

Back in 2020 residents of Mountain View voted in favor of [Measure C](https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/pw/transport/narrow_streets.asp)

> The city ordinance restricts the parking of oversized vehicles which exceed 22 feet in length, or 7 feet in width, or 7 feet in height, including boats, large trucks, and recreational vehicles (RVs), on narrow streets to address traffic safety concerns

The measure has so far not been enforced. Before the city can enforce parking restrictions it must first put up signs. But sign installation has now begun, and we can expect enforcement to also begin soon.

A narrow street as defined by Measure C is any street less that 40 feet wide. This covers 84% of the streets in Mountain View. The city has provided [a map](https://www.mountainview.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=35613) with all the narrow streets highlighted.

However, to decide where you _can_ park your RV, you need more information. Many of the non-narrow streets have parking restrictions. Some have no parking at all. Additionally, it is already illegal to park along any street with bicycle lanes.

So I decided to create a map with positive parking information.

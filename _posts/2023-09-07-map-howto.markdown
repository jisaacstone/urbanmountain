## A Video

I have taught myself how to used qgis over the last three years.
I have been asked how I make my maps. Usually what I do is find an interesting dataset, and then try to visualize that data with QGIS.
So when I found [this dataset](https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Research/Pages/wp1901.aspx)
on estimated land values, I thought I might make a video of me turning the dataset into a map.

It did not go exactly as planned, and making a video is much harder than I expected.
Regardless, here is the video.

If you prefer a blog post, I recommend checking out [this tutorial](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/performing_table_joins.html).
The content is similar but the level of detail is much higher.

## Details

The dataset contains US Census tract ids. I have worked with us census data many times, and the shapefiles are [freely available](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)

To link the property value data with the census geospatial data, I exported the property value data as csv.

Then I could import that data as a [delimited text layer](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/opening_data.html#importing-a-delimited-text-file)
And I can use the [Joins tab](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#joins-properties) to relate both datasets.

I found out about joins recently, using the python console instead.
Using joins is much easier and you don't need to be a programmer.
But it is a bit tricky and I run into a common problem in the video: the id's don't quite match up.

I solve this problem by creating a [virtual field](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html#creating-a-virtual-field).
Now that my data is properly joined I can use symbology tab to create a nice map.

Except it turns out that the dataset only contains information for a very few census tracts.
So I can't make any useful visualization with it.

Hopefully you learned a bit about the process.

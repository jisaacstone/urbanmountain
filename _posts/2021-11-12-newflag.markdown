Like most cities, Mountain View has a flag.

Like most cities, the flag is just the seal of the city on a blue background.

I am no vexillologist, but I thought I could do a bit better than an [SOB](https://vexillology.fandom.com/wiki/Seal_on_a_Bedsheet).

The flag of the city of mountain view is rarely used by the city of mountain view. Often instead we see this graphic, with trees and a mountain.

This is nice. I thought with some clean lines focused on the tree trees it would make a nice flag.

I kept the gold for the sun and blue for the mountain, green for the grass and trees.

I like the straight lines, it is easy to draw and remember. But the trees don't look like trees anymore.
So I brought back the trees from the logo.

![logo trees]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/flags/circle_trees.png "with trees")

Looks nice. But I wanted to do one more. One of my favorite trees here are the coast redwoods, so I thought I'd go for that aesthetic.

That's it. Personally I am most happy with the redwoods version. Would love to see some other people have a go.

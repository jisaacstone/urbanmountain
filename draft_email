If now is not a good time I can wait a bit. Would June be better? I prefer to get it settled this year.

Here are the main points I want changed

3% increase should be gone

Child support should be until 18

Ratio of child support to spousal support is off. Child support should be higher and spousal support should be lower.

Spousal support should be for 5 years.

We can meet to discuss.

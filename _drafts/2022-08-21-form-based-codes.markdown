It's R3 update time again.

I watched all the neighborhood meetings. There seems to be some confusion about what the update will actually do.

The big change this is supposed to accomplish is to remove the "number of units" guidelines the city currently has, and replace them with a form-based approach.

Let's look at the current [zoning ordinance](https://library.municode.com/ca/mountain_view/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIITHCO_CH36ZO_ARTIVREZO_DIV5MUMIR3ZODIST) to see what is being replaced.

While changes in height, setbacks, FAR, etc are proposed, the biggest change is the removal of the lot area to dwelling unit chart, which looks like this.

*Minimum Lot Area Required (square feet) by Number of Dwelling Units*

|Zone |2 units |3 units |4 units |5 units |Additional units |
|R3-1 |7,000 |12,000 |14,000 |15,000 |1,000 per unit|
|R3-1.25 |7,000 |12,000 |14,000 |15,250 |1,250 per unit |
|R3-1.5 |7,000 |12,000 |14,000 |15,500 |1,500 per unit |
|R3-2 |7,000 |12,000 |14,000 |16,000 |2,000 per unit |
|R3-2.2 |7,000 |12,000 |14,200 |16,400 |2,200 per unit |
|R3-2.5 |7,000 |12,000 |14,500 |17,000 |2,500 per unit |
|R3-3 |7,000 |12,000 |15,000 |18,000 |3,000 per unit |
|R3-4 |7,000 |12,000 |16,000 |20,000 |4,000 per unit |
|R3-D |6,000 |7,000 |8,000 |9,000 |850 sq. ft. for each additional unit up to 30 units, and 800 sq. ft. for each additional unit for 31 or more units. |

This city is proposing replacing this chart with a form-based code.
A form based code is only concerned with how the building looks from the outside. So as long as the building complies with the code the number of units is irrelevant.


The existing r3 chart was not discussed by anyone in any of the neighborhood meetings. Instead there was a focus on the 2020 vs 2022 approach, height, shadows, walkability, ownership, taxes, parking, and so on.

So, setting aside all those distractions, the fundamental questions are these:

1. Should the city throw out the lot size to unit chart?
2. Should a form-based code replace it?


## The Chart: What is it Good For?


## Is a Form-Based Code the Best Replacement?


Alternatives:

* Impact Zoning
* Nothing

The fear of "spillover parking" keeps us trapped.

If a company wanted to charge employees who used the parking lot, it would be prevented from doing so.
We fear the employees will park nearby for free, and then walk.

If an apartment building wanted to charge residents for each designated parking space, no one could argue that is unjust.
People who own more or fewer than the designated number of spaces per unit would like to be able to pay for what they need and no more.
But we can't let this happen, for fear of spillover.

If any new business wants to open it must provide exactly enough free parking, or else spillover might occur.

If the city decides to lower the parking requirements you will soon hear loud fears of the coming parking catastrophe.

If we want to move away from the car, the parking situation cannot easily be solved incrementally. Fear of spillover will paralyze.
To make progress we must first confront this fear.

The fact that free curb parking exists forces us to constrain what owners of private parking do. Free curb parking is a shared resource
and we do not want it exploited by some for their personal gain. For example if a developer built apartments without providing parking
so residents just parked on the street we would feel that is unfair.

So we force developers to provide free parking, to protect the precious shared resource.

We are stuck in a corner because any move may cause free curb parking to be overused or exploited.

To move forward we must move boldly.

All curb parking must be removed, restricted, or paid.
